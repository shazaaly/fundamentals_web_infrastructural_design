<strong>What is a server?</strong>

Server a powerful computer or machine with suffecient resources, can be physical or virtual also with dedicated CPU, memory, storage and resources to provide functionalities and services to other computers known as clients over a network

<strong>What is the role of the domain name?</strong>
Domain name is human readable to be used in URL to navigate the corresponding web site needed by user, DNS will translate it into corresponding machine readable ip address.

<strong>What type of DNS record www is in https://example.com ?</strong>

- CNAME canonical record. human readable alias that insures that www.domain_name.com will map as well as dpmain_name.com to the same ip address.
- This simplifies the process of accessing a website by allowing users to reach the site using either the "www" prefix or the domain name alone.

<strong>What is the role of the web server ? </strong>

What is the role of the application server ?

- The application server focuses on processing dynamic requests and executing business logic required to generate and serve dynamic web pages to users. It serves as the intermediary layer between the web server and the database, managing data processing and interaction.

What is the role of the database ?

- storing structured data for applications and websites, application server transmit requests that needs data stored in database, then response is back from database server to application server carrying requested data. request may involve data retrieval or update or delete.
  What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website

What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website ?

- When a user enters a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) in their web browser or clicks on a link, the browser initiates an HTTP request to the corresponding web server. The HTTP request includes information about the resource being requested, any additional data or parameters, and the method of the request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Issues in one server infrastructural design:

- SPOF:
  if the single server experiences a hardware failure, software crash, or any other issue, the entire system becomes unavailable, leading to website
  downtime
- Traffic Overload:
  Since all incoming traffic is directed to a single server, there's a risk of traffic overload during peak usage periods. A sudden surge in user activity, such as during product launches, promotions, or viral content, can lead to a bottleneck and reduced responsiveness.
